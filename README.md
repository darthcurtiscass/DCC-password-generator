# Password Generator Starter Code
A password generator built in Javascript to provide secure passwords.

## Usage
The generate password button can be clicked to trigger a prompt, which will ask the user how many characters they would like to include in their password. Then the user will be prompted with follow up questions, to see if the randomly generated password should contain: numbers, UpperCase letters, LowerCase letters, and/or special characters. User will be able to clear the text field by pressing the generate password button and answering the prompts to generate a new password.
